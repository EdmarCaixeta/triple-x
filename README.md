This is my first project in C++ and my first experience about creating games (even though you don't want to call this a game because of it's simplicty).
To compile this, in terminal:
    
    g++ main.cpp -o <name of executable>
    
    ./<name of executable>

About Triple X game:
	Triple X is a simple game about guessing 3 numbers based in sum and product tips. This code and idea is inspired by: Unreal Engine C++ Developer: Learn C++ and Make Video Games course made by GameDev.tv on Udemy website.
